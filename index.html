            <h3>Flashes everyone including the teammets and most of the time does not seem to care about it!!</h3>
            <p>
                Breach, the bionic Swede, fires powerful, targeted kinetic blasts to aggressively clear a path through enemy ground. The damage and disruption he inflicts ensures no fight is ever fair.
            </p>
            <p>Breach's main gimmick is the ability to use all of his abilities through the geometry of the map,whether it is through walls, roofs, or terrain. This ability set rewards experienced players for knowing the maps well. His abilities also seem to reward an aggressive playstyle despite most of his abilities being crowd-control based.</p>
